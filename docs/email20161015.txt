Hello

I have a new version of ICSTool working at:

	http://icstool2.tupl.us

with WEB site login/password: 

	emprep/user101

Added to this version are:

1. More 'help' pages.

2. Integration of information from the EmPrep database

3. More efficient WEB site navigation

Please check it out by trying 

1. to Sign In and checking the information we have on you. 

2. to Report Damage to your house and see if the information we have for your address is correct.

I would appreciate any comments.

Thank you
