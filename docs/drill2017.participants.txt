I thought the drill went relatively well, especially the radio communications.
It was great to get more people aware of the EmPrep procedures.

Disappointingly, only one or two people outside myself 
seemed to have used the ICSTool, and briefly at that.

Here are some deficiencies I noticed:

1. No one signed in--not even on paper.
   The people out in the divisions should sign in.  
   Perhaps, signing in should be the first step in ICS participation. 

2. Many response teams were form from random people.
   We did not know what training people had for the response teams.

3. Some of writing on the whiteboard was illegible.

4. Communications were not time stamped.

5. Response teams were not tracked--who, where, when, what.

6. Great deal of commotion around the whiteboard made it difficult to read.

7. Paper notes were sometimes illegible and were not organized.

8. People did not know how to communicate damage reports.

The ICSTool could help solve some of these problems 
in that if we practiced with it we would all
learn how the ICS is organized and functions.
It would be good at tracking information, but it will take some learning by the users.
