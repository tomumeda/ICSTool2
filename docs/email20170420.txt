Hello Khin, BDPNN members

I have developed a WEB-based app (ICSTool) that may help neighborhood CERT groups 
get organized and operate an Incident Command System during drills and disasters.
I did some limited testing during our Northside-EmPrep Neighborhood drills, and concluded that the ICSTool is could be useful in alleviating some of the difficulties in organizing CERT groups and running Incident Command Systems.

The ICSTool is by no means a polished app, but in its current form it can demonstrate some of its capabilities.  More documentation on it is available once you Sign-In and are at the User Action Menu under the link “ICSTool Info”.  A few of its contents is specific to the Northside-EmPrep Neighborhood, but the ICSTool can easily be adapted to individual neighborhood groups.

This app is by no means complete and needs improvements which are driven by the needs of a larger user base.  And so, I would like to get other people involved with the ICSTool via comments, advice, other implementations, and/or collaborations.

A public version of the ICSTool is available at:

Please contact me if you encounter any problems accessing the ICSTool or if you have any questions.

Thank you
