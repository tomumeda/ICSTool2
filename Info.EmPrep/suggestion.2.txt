Here are ICC operational objectives for drill:

1. Sign-in all drill participants at the ICC and in the field.

2. Log all ICC communications, e.g., Damage Assessments info, Response Teams communications.

3. Assign Response Team members according to the skills needed for the situation.

4. Log staffing of ICC roles and Response Teams.

There is a necessity to maintain paper records in case the ICSTool is not or becomes unavailable. 
A possible way is to organize a paper system that is parallel with the ICSTool data structure 
and is redundant with real-time operational information, e.g., Personnel, Damage Assessments, etc.
A possible organization for the paper system which will help keep realtime data organized and logged
is as follows:

1. Use 5 master binders/clipboards to track:

       Personnel (Sign Ins)
       Damage Assessments
       Messages
       Response Teams
       ICC Staffing

2. Each binder are only directly accessible by the Scribe, the Radio Operator,
and the ICS Tool specialist.  Each binder is shared among these three roles
and are immediately accessible to them.  

3. Data flow for each binder:

SignIn Binder:
Inputs:
       SignIns via radio -> [Radio Operator] -> SignIn Binder+Staffing Binder
       SignIns via runner -> [Scribe] -> SignIn Binder+Staffing Binder
       SignIns via ICS Tool -> [ICS Tool Specialist] -> SignIn Binder+Staffing Binder
Outputs:
       staff availability requests -> [Scribe] -> response from SignIn Binder
       staff availability requests -> [ICS Tool Specialist] -> response from ICS Tool
       SignIn Binder -> [ICS Tool Specialist] -> ICS Tool(sync)

Damage Assessments Binder:
Inputs:
       DamageInfo via radio -> [Radio Operator] -> Damage Assessment Binder
       DamageInfo via runner -> [Scribe] -> Damage Assessment Binder
       DamageInfo via ICS Tool -> [ICS Tool Specialist] -> Damage Assessment Binder
Outputs:
       Damage Assessment Binder -> [Scribe] -> status board
       Damage Assessment Binder -> [ICS Tool Specialist] -> ICS Tool(sync)

Message Binder:
Inputs:
       Messages from ICC (note/voice) -> [Scribe] -> Messages Binder
       Messages (ICS Tool) -> [ICS Tool Specialist] -> Messages Binder
       Messages via radio -> [Radio Operator] -> Messages Binder
Outputs:
       Messages Binder -> [Radio Operator] -> radio
       Messages Binder -> [Scribe] -> status board+ICC(note/voice)

Response Team Binder:
Inputs:
       Assignments from ICC (note/voice) -> [Scribe] -> Response Team Binder+Damage Assessment Binder+Messages Binder(notify)
       Assignments from ICC (ICS Tool) -> [ICS Tool Specialist] -> Response Team Binder+Damage Assessment Binder+Messages Binder(notify)
Outputs:
       Response Team Binder -> [Scribe] -> status board
       Response Team Binder -> [ICS Tool Specialist] -> ICS Tool(sync)

Staffing Binder:
Inputs:
       Assignments from ICC (note/voice) -> [Scribe] -> Staffing Binder+Messages Binder(notify)
       Assignments from ICC (ICS Tool) -> [ICS Tool Specialist] -> Staffing Binder+Messages Binder(notify)
       Self Assignments (note/voice) -> [Scribe] -> Staffing Binder
