Hi neighbors,

I have scheduled a CERT meeting at the former Hillside School on Sunday, March 22 starting at 3:00 pm.  I confirmed the time and date with both Sam and Katie Hawn, the new CERT coordinator.

Katie was going to bring hand-outs.  In order to gauge the quantity needed, my plan was to send email with URL for signup at Eventbrite as a private event.  However, Sam beat me to the punch by posting it on Facebook.  So I will take RSVP via email.

Please send the meeting information to your neighborhood group.   

I made the attached generic flyer, and will be distributing to my block on Buena Vista.  Holly is distributing flyers to the 1500 block of Leroy, as well as neighbors on Hill Ct. 

Let me know if you have questions.

Cynthia
